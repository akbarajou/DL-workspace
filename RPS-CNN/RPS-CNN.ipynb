    "# **_Rock-Paper-Scissors Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)_**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying hand gestures of Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The CNN will be trained using TensorFlow and Keras on a dataset of hand gesture images and evaluated for its accuracy in recognizing these gestures. This notebook is divided into the following main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries**: We will begin by importing the necessary libraries required for building and training our CNN model.\n",
    "2. **Dataset Preparation**: We'll load and preprocess the Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset, including augmenting images for better training performance.\n",
    "3. **Model Building**: We'll design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored to classify Rock-Paper-Scissors gestures accurately.\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: The model will be trained using the prepared dataset, with appropriate hyperparameter tuning for optimization.\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation**: Finally, we will evaluate the trained model on test data to verify its performance and visualize predictions.\n",

    "### **_1. Importing Necessary Libraries_**\n",
    "To start building and training our Convolutional Neural Network for Rock-Paper-Scissors classification, we need to import several essential libraries. Below is the list of libraries utilized in this project:\n"
